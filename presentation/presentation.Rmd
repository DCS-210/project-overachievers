## Goal 
### We seek to find correlations between countries' Happiness scores and specific factors.

???
- We sought to find correlations between countries' Happiness scores and specific factors such as family, percent GDP and healthcare spending on pharmaceutical drugs.

# Background

* Two pieces of information we are interested in: 
  * World Happiness Report, a measurement of state of global happiness 
  * Pharmaceutical drug spending, a potential contributing factor a nation’s happiness score
  * Both were pulled from kaggle.com


???
- The World Happiness Report measures the state of global happiness using a survey where respondents rate their own lives based on different factors and was availible at kaggle.com. This includes family, freedom, health, economy and trust towards the government. This report is important because since it first came out in 2012, it gained global recognition from governments, organizations and civil society and has been administered every year since. The measurements of well-being could potentially be used to assess the progress of a nation, informing their  policy-making decisions from happiness indicators measured in the report. 
- In addition, we are interested in taking in other factors that could possibly contribute to the happiness score outside the indicators that the world happiness report currently collects. We found a dataset (from kaggle.com) on the pharmaceutical drug spending by countries with respect to the GDP and the total healthcare spending in a specific year. We are intersted in the potential relationships between pharmecuitical spending and the happiness report data.

# Hypotheses 

* Non-western countries have higher family importance scores influencing happiness scores.
* The higher the percent of drug spending on GDP, the higher the percent spent on pharmaceutical drugs in healthcare.
* The higher the percent GDP spending on pharmaceuticals, the lower the happiness score of European countries.


???
- research has shown that non-western countries have higher collectivism values than western countries that tend to be more individualistic, thus, we hypothesize that non-western countries have higher family importance scores influencing happiness scores.

class: center, middle

* We ran a linear regression to see the potential relationship between percent of GPD (spending on pharmaceuticals) and Happiness Scores. 
* The linear regression line found was: 
happiness score = 8.368 - 1.423(Percent GDP)
* The adjusted r-squared was 0.38 meaning that 38% of the variance of the happiness scores were explained by the variance of the percent spending of GDP. 
* This at least shows preliminary evidence for accepting our hypothesis that the higher the percent GDP spending on pharmaceuticals, the lower the happiness score of European countries.

The greater our residual value, the greater the size of the point. The size of the point and the length of the vertical line from the regression line to the point are correlated. Green indicates a smaller residual value while red represents a much higher residual value.

Switzerland that is not in the EU has a much higher happiness score than what is expected. The other western european countries seem to also have a higher normalized residual score compared to other European regions. It seems that Northern Europe tends to have a lower normalized residual scores, along with Eastern Europe.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
